# -Tip-Calculator
## Function of this Calculator:
This repo is used to calculate the bill  according to the percentage tip offered when it is to be splitted among persons 
- I basically used variables to store data entered through the "input" function .
- I carried out some mathematical operations in calulating the bills.
Well....these are my baby steps in python and I hope to do more creative repls.
## See yaa!
